# Loop of the Rings (LoR) System

## Overview
Loop of the Rings (LoR) is a fully decentralized, reliable cooperative system designed to facilitate collaboration among participants in various applications. This repository provides the necessary scripts to run simulations, generate results, and visualize data.

## Running the System
The system can be executed using the following scripts:

### Gamma-Based Results
To obtain gamma-based results, run:
```bash
./run.sh [option]
```

### Scenario-Based Results
To obtain scenario-based results, run:
```bash
./run-linear.sh [option]
```

#### Available Options:
- `cleanup` - Cleans up the previous output before running a new simulation.
- `save` - Saves the generated results for further analysis.

## Plotting Data
Once the results are generated, you can visualize the data using the provided plotting tool:
```bash
python3 tools/plot-data.py output/ linear-output/
```
Here, `output/` and `linear-output/` represent the respective output directories generated by `run.sh` and `run-linear.sh`.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the system:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip` if needed):
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
  ```
- Ensure the shell scripts (`run.sh` and `run-linear.sh`) have executable permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x run.sh run-linear.sh
  ```
